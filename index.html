        	<h2>About Natural disaster</h2>
        	  <p>Environment is the surrounding in which an organization operates, including air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, human beings, and their interrelation</p>
        	  <p>Todayâ€™s world is quite different from the one it has been before. Urbanization and industrialization negatively influenced our world. From the beginning of the new century, the problem of the environment turned into a widespread problem, which is being discussed all over the world. We are no longer living in calm and stable environment. Plants, trees, flowers are the gifts of nature, aimed to inspire us. One of the most obvious problems for the environment is a question of cutting down trees, mainly in the virgin areas. Trees are considered to be the lungs of the Earth. </p>
        	  <p>Since the turn of the new millennium the issue of the environment has suddenly evolved into a widespread issue which is greatly discussed throughout the world. No longer are humans living in a world where the environment is serene or stable but much rather becoming unrecognizable and diminishing before our eyes. The plants, trees and flowers are life forms which God has created for us to enjoy its beauty but it is now solely up to us and many other organizations to protect preserve and respect how fragile our environment really is.</p>
        	  <p>One of the most evident problems associated to the environment is the issue of the logging of trees, mainly in undisturbed places such as the Amazon basin.  Trees that are made way for farming are burnt up releasing deadly amounts of carbon and thus leading to the problem of global warming. As its names suggest the world is slowly warming up and without any notice the environment which God has gave us will be slowly eradicated. The daily lives which humans carry on about every day are also a factor influencing on our environment and global warming. </p>
